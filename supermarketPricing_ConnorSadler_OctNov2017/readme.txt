Catalog
- cfstodo: notes

ShoppingBasket/ShoppingBasketItem
- I kept this simple so that if you want to buy multiple tins of beans you'll add more than one
  item to your basket. But that could be changed in future if required
  i.e. we could add a "numberOfItems" property to ShoppingBasketItem

MonetaryAmount
- In reality this may be linked to some sort of monetary system e.g. Sterling
